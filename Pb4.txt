Allows you to search for text within a file. Although MS-DOS itself is not case sensitive, 
when DB typing in the string that you are looking for with the find command, it is case sensitive.

Additionally, this command is used to find text within a file, not the actual file itself DB. 
If you are wanting to search or find a file with a particular name, use the dir command.
