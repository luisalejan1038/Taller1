Allows you to search for text within a file. Although MS-DOS itself is not case sensitive, 
when DB typing in the string that you are looking for with the find command, it is case sensitive.

Additionally, this command is used to find text within a file, not the actual file itself DB. 
If you are wanting to search or find a file with a particular name, use the dir command.

DB


Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead DB of the character that
normally follows a file name. For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after
each file name instead of the usual newline.
This option makes the output unambiguous, even in DB the presence of file names
containing unusual characters like newlines.
This option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and
xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even DB those that contain newline characters. 
Report Unix-style byte offsets.
This switch causes grep DB to report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text
file, i.e. with CR characters stripped off. This DB will produce results identical to
running grep on a Unix machine.
This option has no effect unles DB s -b option is also used; it has no effect on
platforms other than MS-DOS and DB MS-Windows.
